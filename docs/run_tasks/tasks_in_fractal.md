# Within Fractal

Thanks to the package manifest and to their structure, the tasks in
`fractal_tasks_core.tasks` can be run within the [Fractal
platform](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io); this consists in a
[backend server](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-server)
which can be accessed by one of the two available clients (a [command-line
client](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-client) and a
[web-client](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-web)).

The `fractal-demos` repository lists a set of relevant examples, including:

* [How to set up a `fractal-server` instance](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-demos/tree/main/examples/server);
* [How to set up a `fractal-client` command-line client](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-demos/tree/main/examples/00_user_setup);
* How to use the command-line client to submit a series of typical workflows (based on `fractal-tasks-core` tasks) to Fractal; see folders from 01 to 10 in the [`examples` folder](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-demos/tree/main/examples).
